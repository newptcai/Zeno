# Zeno -- a collection of helper functions for symbolic computations in Mathematica

## Purpose of the project

In my [recent research](http://www2.math.uu.se/~xinca341/pages/publications.html), I found that I
often have to manipulate large symbolic expressions. Sometimes these equations are even hard to copy
by hand on paper. Using Mathematica helped a lot. It provides many powerful features
for manipulate symbolic expressions--when I do not know how to transform an expression through
programming, at least I can copy-paste it and change it manually.

Zeno is a collection of helper functions that I wrote the past few months. Usually they are just a
wrapper for one-line codes. But I gradually learned to write them in better and more conciser ways,
thanks to many helps that I get from
[mathematica.stackexchange.com](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com).  Hopefully these will also
be helpful for others.

Zeno has three planned sub_packages:

- SumChopper -- Functions for manipulating symbolic expressions.
- FuncBounder -- Upper and lower bounds for special function.
- ProbCutter -- Concentration inequalities and other simple results in probability theory.

The package is named after the accent Greek philosopher [Zeno of Citium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium).
